In this assignment, youâ€™ll be asked to predict reading scores using the ELS data.


#1 Create a regression that predicts reading scores as a function of SES, using the training data.
This example compares SES and English test scores, rather than math scores.
```{r}

#Model 1: simple bivariate regression

modeng<-lm(bynels2r~byses1,data=els_train) #outcome on left, predictor on right 

summary(modeng)

g1<-ggplot(els_train, aes(x=byses1,y=bynels2r))+ #specify data and x and y
           geom_point(shape=1)+ #specify points
           geom_smooth(method=lm) #ask for lm line
g1

els_train<-els_train%>%add_predictions(modeng)%>%rename(pred1=pred) #predict using data in memory
```
Like with the Math scores, the results are statisticall significant and with an increase in SES there is also an increase in test score, the higher the income, the higher the test score. With each increse in SES, test scores are predicted to increase by 5.5 points.



#2 Report the RMSE from a validation of your model using the testing data.
```{r}
rmse_eng<-modelr::rmse(modeng,els_train);rmse_eng
```



#3 Add another covariate to your model from 1.
```{r}
modeng2<-lm(bynels2r~as.factor(bypared)+
           byses1,
          data=els_train)

summary(modeng2) 

els_train<-els_train%>%add_predictions(modeng2)%>%rename(predeng2=pred)
```

#4 Again report the RMSE from a validation of your model using the testing data. Did you model improve? By how much?
```{r}
rmse_eng<-modelr::rmse(modeng2,els_train); rmse_eng
```
